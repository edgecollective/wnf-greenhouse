# UF2

Needed on board to run CircuitPython.  
Using version 5 of Circuipython code.

## Setting up or upgrading version of CircuitPython on Feather M4 Express

- Download the appropriate UF2 file [here](https://circuitpython.org/board/feather_m4_express/)

- Plug into laptop via USB

- If CIRCUITPY appears as a drive, then you already have a working CIRCUITPY UF2 file on the board.  Otherwise it might not appear as a drive (no problem if so).

- Double tap RESET button to get into ‘bootloader’ mode

- Drive will now reappear as ‘FEATHER_BOOT’

- Drag UF2 file onto ‘FEATHER_BOOT’

- Board will automatically RESET and reappear as CIRCUITPY
